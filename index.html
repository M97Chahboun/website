                <h3>About Shorebird</h3>
                <p>The problem: Today, businesses write the same app at
                    least twice at 2x the necessary costs, with redundant code-bases, teams, bug lists. Flutter has
                    proven
                    that
                    high-quality multi-platform is possible. However,
                    adopting Flutter within an enterprise can be challenging as the default offerings from Google are
                    sometimes
                    an ill fit or incomplete for non-Google teams.
                    Shorebird is changing that. We're filling in the gaps in the Flutter ecosystem and making it easy
                    for
                    enterprises to adopt multi-platform development.</p>
                <p>Why? We're here to save developers and business time and money, help them provide their customers
                    with
                    better
                    experiences, and hopefully make the world a better place.</p>
                <p>The primary unlock we made in building Flutter was bringing circa 2014 web tech to mobile
                    (reactive
                    programming,
                    hot reload, etc). Shorebird is repeating this by bringing 2023 web tech to mobile (blurring
                    client/server, always up-to-date deploys, etc).</p>

                <p>We're a default-public organization, we operate on a <a
                        href="https://discord.gg/9hKJcWGcaB"></a>public discord</a>, our
                    <a href="https://github.com/shorebirdtech/">source is open</a>, our company <a
                        href="https://github.com/shorebirdtech/handbook">handbook</a> is open. We're globally
                    distributed team operating largely asynchronous.
                </p>

                <p>More information about the company we're trying to build can be found in our public <a
                        href="https://github.com/shorebirdtech/handbook">Handbook</a>.</p>

                <h3>
                    About the role
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Skills</b>: Dart, Flutter, and some amount of one of a systems language (e.g. C++, C, Rust) OR
                    cloud experience (e.g. AWS, GCP) desired. We work on many systems *around* Flutter and Dart, but
                    rarely
                    write Flutter apps. We write the tools others will use to build Flutter apps.
                    Experience working on reused code (e.g. apis, libraries, tools, build systems) will also serve you
                    well.
                </p>

                <h4>How you add value</h4>
                <p>As a founding engineer, you will wear many hats. You will work with a diverse (and distributed) team
                    of exceptional
                    engineers (some who built Flutter or key parts of the Flutter ecosystem initially) to build the
                    future
                    of development
                    for
                    <i>any screen</i>. Most of our work will be <i>around</i> Flutter, making it easier for Flutter
                    developers to
                    deploy
                    to
                    the cloud, build and update applications, etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You will be responsible for many design decisions within the product, and will be expected to be
                    able to
                    make tradeoffs between different approaches. You will be expected to be able to work within a
                    distributed team of
                    engineers to build a product that is easy to use, performant, secure and delightful to developers.
                    That starts of course by building something we ourselves want to use.
                </p>

                <h4>Must have</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interest/willingness to work on a small, distributed team</li>
                    <li>Excited about Shorebird's mission of making high-quality multi-platform the default</li>
                    <li>Passion around creating excellent developer experiences</li>
                    <li>Experience building production software</li>
                    <li>Experience with Dart and Flutter</li>
                    <li>Ability and desire to learn/teach yourself new skills as we go</li>
                    <li>Ability to prioritize your own work among way too many options</li>
                    <li>Excellent English spoken and written communication skills</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Interview process</h4>
                No, we don't ask you to do coding exercises. We're interested most in your past projects/accomplishments
                (do you
                ship stuff?), your
                desire to work at a startup and on this mission in particular, and your ability to communicate clearly.
                We'll have a few conversations, possibly do a small project together and check references. If it's a
                mutual fit, we'll make you an offer.
