agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions (&quot;Terms of Service&quot;). IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO
THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO
BIND SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND ALL USERS WHO ACCESS OUR SERVICES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT TO THESE TERMS

ASSOCIATED WITH IT. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.</p>
<p>If Shorebird makes material changes to these Terms, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our
site before the changes are effective. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including
the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service
after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of

<p>Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While Shorebird prohibits

suspension of your account's access to the API. Shorebird, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or
excessive usage of the API. Shorebird will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior

Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. Shorebird reserves the right to
refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. In the event that Shorebird takes action to suspend or

indemnify Shorebird for any damages finally awarded against, and for reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by,
Shorebird in connection with any such claim, demand, suit or proceeding; provided, that Shorebird (a) promptly
gives You written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (b) gives You sole control of the defense and
settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that You may not settle any claim, demand, suit or

</ul>
<h3 id="f-refund-policy">F. Refund Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you feel you are being billed in error, we strongly encourage you to request a refund from your account or

touch with us, we are limited in what we can do to resolve it.</li>

reinstate it.</li>
